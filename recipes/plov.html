    <h1>Plov</h1>
    <img src="../img/Uzbek-Plov.jpg" alt="Plov">
    <p>Plov is a Central Asian dish of rice, vegetables, meat, and spices that's popular along the Silk Road. 
    It's especially associated with Uzbekistan, where it's a national obsession and a symbol of Uzbek hospitality. 
    Plov is traditionally prepared in a deep cast-iron pot called a kazan by men of the household, each with their own secret recipe. 
    The ingredients are cooked slowly in layers, and the pot is warmed evenly to prevent burning.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh beef</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>2lbs of carrots</li>
        <li>1 tsp of ground cumin</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp of whole cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp of freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tsp of salt</li>
        <li>1.5 Qt of water</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim beef of excess fat and sinews (aka the chewy stuff), pat the meat dry with a paper towel and chop into 1/2″ to 3/4″ pieces</li>
        <li>Preheat your dutch oven (or your large soup pot with a heavy bottom), to high heat. Once it’s hot, stir in your 1/3 cup canola oil. 
            Once oil is hot, add chopped meat and saute uncovered 7 min over high heat until meat is browned, stirring every minute or so so it 
            doesn’t scorch to the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and Add chopped onion, stirring often until onion is softened (5 minutes). Stir in sliced carrots, 
            1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp cumin, 3-4 bay leaves and continue to cook over medium heat 5 minutes 
            until carrots are softened.</li>
        <li>Add 1 3/4 cups hot water, cover & simmer over medium/low heat 45 min or until meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, rinse rice until water runs clear, then drain and set aside (this gets rid of the starch so you won’t end up 
            with a sticky rice).</li>
        <li>Spread rice over the meat and add 4 cups hot water. Sprinkle the rice with 1 1/2 tsp salt (DO NOT STIR), bring to a boil 
            then reduce heat to low and Let cook uncovered until most of the water is absorbed (10 min).</li>
        <li>Cut off the base of your whole garlic head to expose the cloves. Put your head of garlic, cut side down into the center 
            of the rice and sprinkle the top of the rice with 1 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>Poke 7-10 holes through the rice to allow steam to escape to the surface,  reduce the heat to low, then cover and cook 
            an additional 15 minutes or until rice is cooked through. Remove the garlic head and bay leaves and stir everything gently 
            to combine and you’re done.</li>
    </ol>
